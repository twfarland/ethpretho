map all [g ... h] exprs, along with their corresponding source, to {seq g aft [h]} exprs

  
; dual-map (patt along with source) to {seq [] aft []} objects
; map template to {seq [] aft []} objects
; using these, map template to subst objects
; using substed template and environment, make a normal expr, safely replacing atoms.
